# Deep-Learning-ND


This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). It consists of projects solution for udacity Deep learning Nanodegree. 

## The Program's Table Of Contents

### Tutorials

### Introduction to Neural Networks

* Introduction to Neural Networks: Learn how to implement gradient descent and apply it to predicting patterns in student admissions data.

* Sentiment Analysis with NumPy: Learn how to build a sentiment analysis model, predicting if some text is positive or negative.

* Introduction to PyTorch: Learn how to build neural networks in PyTorch and use pre-trained networks for state-of-the-art image classifiers.

### Convolutional Neural Networks

* Convolutional Neural Networks: Visualize the output of layers that make up a CNN. Learn how to define and train a CNN for classifying [MNIST data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), a handwritten digit database that is notorious in the fields of machine and deep learning. Also, define and train a CNN for classifying images in the [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

* Transfer Learning: In practice, most people don't train their own networks on huge datasets; they use **pre-trained** networks such as VGGnet. Here you'll use VGGnet to help classify images of flowers without training an end-to-end network from scratch.

* Weight Initialization: Explore how initializing network weights affects performance.

* Autoencoders: Build models for image compression and de-noising, using feedforward and convolutional networks in PyTorch.

* Style Transfer: Extract style and content features from images, using a pre-trained network. Implement style transfer according to the paper, [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) by Gatys et. al. Define appropriate losses for iteratively creating a target, style-transferred image of your own design!

### Recurrent Neural Networks

* Intro to Recurrent Networks (Time series & Character-level RNN): Recurrent neural networks are able to use information about the sequence of data, such as the sequence of characters in text; learn how to implement these in PyTorch for a variety of tasks.

* Embeddings (Word2Vec): Implement the Word2Vec model to find semantic representations of words for use in natural language processing.

* Sentiment Analysis RNN: Implement a recurrent neural network that can predict if the text of a moview review is positive or negative.

* Attention: Implement attention and apply it to annotation vectors.

### Generative Adversarial Networks

* Generative Adversarial Network on MNIST: Train a simple generative adversarial network on the MNIST dataset.

* Batch Normalization: Learn how to improve training rates and network stability with batch normalizations.

* Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN): Implement a DCGAN to generate new images based on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.

* CycleGAN: Implement a CycleGAN that is designed to learn from unpaired and unlabeled data; use trained generators to transform images from summer to winter and vice versa.

### Deploying a Model (with AWS SageMaker)

* Learn to deploy pre-trained models using AWS SageMaker.

### Projects

* [Bike sharing](https://github.com/HusseinAndia/Deep-Learning-ND/tree/master/1-%20Bike%20sharing): Implement a neural network in NumPy to predict bike rentals.

* [Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/HusseinAndia/Deep-Learning-ND/tree/master/2-%20Dog%20Breed%20Classifier): Build a convolutional neural network with PyTorch to classify any image (even an image of a face) as a specific dog breed.

* [TV Script Generation](https://github.com/HusseinAndia/Deep-Learning-ND/tree/master/3-%20TV_script_generation): Train a recurrent neural network to generate scripts in the style of dialogue from Seinfeld.

* [Face Generation](https://github.com/HusseinAndia/Deep-Learning-ND/tree/master/4-Face_generation): Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of new and realistic human faces.
